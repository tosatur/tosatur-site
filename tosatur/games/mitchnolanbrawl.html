It was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken_7">Tekken 7.</a></p> <p>The game used <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer">Steam's</a> multiplayer service; each match could have up to 4 people in a free-for-all format. The last fighter standing wins.</p> <p>I made the characters by taking a picture of my friends' faces, then putting them on a base mesh, and modelling clothes over them.</p> <p>Each of the characters has abilities based on their real-life counterpart; for example, one of my friends is really into weightlifting, so his character had the ability to throw massive weight plates at his opponents.</p> <p>I put a lot of effort into the UI of this game; I based it somewhat on Tekken's UI. It doesn't look as good, but I'm quite proud of it, as it's definitely the best UI I've made.</p> <p>I initially gave every character the ability to heal themselves, but after playtesting, we found that it would make the matches extremely long and drawn out, so I ended up removing the ability.</p> <p>Some characters have the ability to do a strong kick which sends the opponent flying; this is probably the most fun thing in the game.</p> </div> </div> </div>
