The player is in the corner of a test chamber."> <p>Mitch Nolan Simulator 31 is a platformer in which you have to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_jumping">rocket jump</a> to reach the end of the stage.</p> <p>There are 3 chambers in which to test your rocket-jumping ability. Nothing happens once you reach the end, but you can feel proud of yourself if you want. The design of the chambers was inspired by the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">Portal (2007).</a></p> <p>The thing i put most effort into were the explosion effects. The "rockets" (untextured balls) explode with a bright flash, shaking your screen. They leave a black burn mark wherever they hit.</p> <p>The music in the main menu is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/jis3y5/car_song_heard_on_chinese_radio/">Kyrgyz song</a> that was heard playing on the radio in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang">Xinjiang.</a> If you find any info regarding this song, please <a href="../contact.html">contact</a> me.
