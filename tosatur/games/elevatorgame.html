A dark blue room can be seen outside the elevator doors."> <p>This is a first person multiplayer co-op game in which you and your friends have to ride an elevator and survive weird and dangerous floors in an infinitely tall building set in a fictional version of the USA. This game is also my first made in Unreal Engine 5.</p> <p>For the art style, I tried to juxtapose the cartoony characters and weird architecture with realistic shading and models. I think it is my best looking game so far.</p> <p>The floors vary in size between small rooms and huge landscapes. some rooms contain NPCs which will join you on your journey through the building. This is also my first game with voice acting.</p> <p>The game is still in development, and likely will be for a while. So far I am happy with the state of the game, and I have learned a lot from making it. Making this game has tested my knowledge of everything I've learned about Unreal Engine.</p> </div> </div> </div>
