The reasoning is this:</p> <ul> <li>gh from <i>enough</i> <li>o from <i>women</i> <li>ti from <i>nation</i> </ul> <p>Put these together and you get <i>ghoti</i>. Obviously, this is untrue. There is a reason why you automatically pronounce ghoti similarly to goatee; English spelling rules simply don't work like that.</p> <p>While it is true (and maybe illogical) that these spellings make such sounds, they only make these sounds in specific parts of a word. This concept, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics"><i>phonotactics</i></a>, explains away this misconception.</p> <ul> <li>gh only sounds like <i>f</i> when following <i>ou</i> or <i>au</i> <li>o is only pronounced <i>i</i> in the word <i>women</i> <li>ti only sounds like <i>sh</i> when followed by a vowel </ul> <p>You could however, write the word <i>fish</i> as <i>pfysche</i>.</p> <h2>Inuit has many words for snow</h2> <p>This one is pretty ambiguous, but the idea is that, because Inuit peoples are around snow a lot, they have more words for it.</p> <p>The original claim comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas">Franz Boas</a>, who, in his study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskaleut_languages">Eskaleut languages</a> in Canada, found that they had around the same number of words for snow as English, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic_language">polysynthetic</a> nature of the language allows each word root to be modified to create greater nuance. This means that noun-adjective pairs, and even entire sentences can be expressed as single words in these languages.</p> <p>Depending on how you define <i>word</i>, you could say that Inuit languages have a not-exceptional number of words for snow, or that they have a near infinite amount.</p> <p>On a related note, English actually has 12-40 words that can mean snow, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_languages">Sámi languages</a> in northern Scandinavia have been found to have as many as 300 words for snow, and as many as 1000 words for reindeer.</p> <h2>Made-up words</h2> <p>Another common one i've seen is people (like <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwritingcooperative.com%2F5-words-that-don-t-exist-and-5-weird-ones-that-do-d5caa5c0aabc">this</a> article) confidently stating that certain words are "not a word."</p> <p>The selection of words that some claim are fake is completely arbitrary, but are often slang terms, or perceived grammatical errors. At risk of catastrophically dating this post, I'll list a few below.</p> <ul> <li><i>rizz</i> <li><i>irregardless</i> <li><i>ain't</i> <li><i>orientate</i> <li><i>ginormous</i> <li><i>funner</i> </ul> <p>All words are made up, if a word is in common use but isn't in a dictionary, that is a failure of the dictionary.</p> </div> </div> </div>
