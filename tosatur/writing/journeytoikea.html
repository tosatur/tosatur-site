One in Richmond, and one in Springvale. At the time, I had no car, and I didn't know that the Richmond one existed, so I decided to go to IKEA in Springvale, which was much further.</p> <p>Doing so required the use of public transport. In the early hours of the day, I hopped on the bus, and made my way to IKEA.</p> <img src="writing/images/mapofmelbourne.png" alt="A crudely drawn map of Melbourne, Australia."> <p>The journey there was unbelievably boring. so boring, It felt like I had transcended the confines of my earthly body, and ascended to a realm of pure nothingness. I percieved nothing, I was not there.</p> <p>The bus stops came and went. Templestowe. Doncaster. Blackburn. Glen Waverley. People boarded and disembarked, but through all their micro-journeys, I was there, at the back of the bus. No music, no headphones. Sitting. Waiting.</p> <p>Now that I think about it, I don't know why I subjected myself to such mind-numbing boredom. I had my phone and headphones on me the entire time.</p> <p>What snapped me out of my meditative trance was an old Asian man entering the bus, around the halfway point of my journey. After a brief word with the driver, he came to the back of the bus and sat across from me.</p> <p>When I tried to re-enter my state of pure unfocus, I spotted movement in my peripheral vision. I turned, and I saw the old man showing me his phone. On the screen was a Wordpress site with a red ornate background.</p> <p>"My poetry," he said.</p> <p>I looked at him, then back to the screen.</p> <p>"Cool," I replied. "Did you make this?"</p> <p>"My daughter," he said, scrolling down the page, showing me all his poems, but too fast for me to be able to read any.</p> <p>After a brief conversation, the old man reached his stop. as I watched him walk down the footpath through the bus's windows, I realised something.</p> <p>I forgot to ask for the URL.</p> <p>If the poet in question is reading this somehow, please send me the link to your cool site. Thank you.</p> <p>Anyway, after many hours (2), and many kilometres (42), I got off at my stop. From there, there was about a 20 minute walk before finally reaching IKEA. As I trekked through the final leg of my journey, I walked past a pile of kids' tricycles. I considered commandeering one, to assist me on my quest, but I decided against it, because there was a scary man there.</p> <p>As I clambered up the suburban hills, I saw it. A deep blue cube on the horizon. IKEA. This is what Columbus must have felt.</p> <p>But my prize was snatched away from me. I felt a vibration in my pocket, and a sense of dread filled my mind. My mum was ringing me. She told me to come home.</p> <p>Devastated, I headed back to the bus stop. You may be asking; what was the reason for this epic, <i>7 Years in Tibet</i>-esque journey? The answer: none.</p> </div> </div> </div>
