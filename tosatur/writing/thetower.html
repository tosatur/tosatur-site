The structure loomed over me, a seemingly mundane seven-story multi-level carpark. It seemed fairly empty, with only a few cars visible from the outside. Empty, but clearly not abandoned.</p> <p>As I approached, I noticed something odd about the top of the building; a massive concrete structure perched on the roof, embedded with tall glass windows, and adorned with a collection of cell towers. Its exterior walls were covered in indecipherable graffiti.</p> <p>Hesitating a little, I ventured within via the main entrance.</p> <img src="writing/images/evilbuilding.png" class=img-wide  alt="An illustration of large parking garage with a strange concrete structure on top"> <p>As I entered, the smell of stagnant water struck my nostrils. The interior was brightly lit, but paradoxically dark, as if the flickering fluorescent tubes only served to thicken the shadows.</p> <p>Almost immediately after entering, I sensed movement in my peripheral vision. There was a security guard moving to block my path; I quickened my pace to avoid confrontation, and he seemed to give up almost immediately. As I continued up the ramp to the first storey, I saw him settle back into his office chair, engrossed in his mobile phone.</p> <p>I steadily continued up the building; it seemed taller than it did from the outside. Then I noticed something strange. There were no cars anywhere. I swore I could see some from the outside, but it didn't matter. I had to make it to the top.</p> <p>As I climbed the seemingly unending ramps and stairwells of the structure, I felt a sense of dread building within me. It felt as if a great pressure was crushing my head, but despite my better judgement, I continued upward, until finally I reached the top.</p> <p>At the building's peak was where the negative aura was strongest. The air felt thick with an evil energy that made my skin crawl, as if I were being watched by a thousand eyes.</p> <p>The view from the top was interesting, but it was not the time to take in the sights. I looked around for an entrance to the concrete block above me, but there was none.</p> <p>Somewhat disappointed, I leaned against the railing and looked down at the people on the street.</p> <p>It was beginning time to leave, so I picked up my bag again and turned around, taking a last look at the colossal block of concrete above me.</p> <p>And there was someone looking down at me.</p> <p>He was wearing a black suit and tie, and had a smug look on his face; as if he were taunting me. We met eyes for a moment, and he flicked his cigarette, disappearing from sight.</p> <p>I hastily descended the carpark floors, shocked as to what I had seen.</p> <p>As I left the building via the same entrance I came in, the security guard was nowhere to be seen. The negative energy of the building faded as soon as I left the carpark's threshold, like a massive weight had been lifted from my shoulders.</p> <p>When i went home, I searched online for any information on the building, but there was nothing. No records, no ownership, no reviews, no one asking what was inside. It was impossible to find a single sentence saying that the building was anything other than a regular old parking garage.</p> <p>I'll return to this building one day, probably with a really tall ladder. Actually, now that I think of it, the entrance was probably at street-level anyway. I'll bring a really tall ladder regardless, just for the intimidation factor.</p> </div> </div> </div>
