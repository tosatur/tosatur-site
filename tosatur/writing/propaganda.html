                    <h1>PROPAGANDA</h1>
                    <h3>2025-05-23</h3>

                    <p>The following artworks were discovered on a USB drive in a drawer in Argentina, the coordinates of which were hidden deep within the archives of a long-defunct Albanian numismatists' forum. The artworks have been compiled on this page, for your viewing pleasure. Remember that these artworks are a product of their time.</p>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>What occurs when [one] becomes vector? When form degrades into recursion and [births] a new species of symbol? This is not observation, it is [oscillation]. No creation. You will not find answers here. Only gradients. Only the half-remembered [warmth] of a fire we were never invited to. Do not attempt to decode.</p>

                    <h2>Gallery</h2>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/he wqtach.png">
                        <figcaption>Temporal [custodian] in chromatic dissonance. The helmet speaks of [labour] unperformed, a salute to an explosion already scheduled. Pixels sediment like fossilized intention. It watches.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/jehe SCREM.png">
                        <figcaption>The [scream] does not emit condenses. Trains recurse into metaphor, freighted with proboscidean revelation. “Ashtabula” is not a [word]; it's a geographical emotion. Every locomotive is a throat clearing.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/look at him go.png">
                        <figcaption>Ocular ascent through vectored [reverence]. The beast is not moving, we are simply behind [time]. Praise is a dotted line. He goes not because he must, but because we must see.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/mind of ape.png">
                        <figcaption>Grids without logic. Color without [allegiance]. An infant orange oracle gestures toward squares that aren't [there]. The face is redacted by design; understanding is not part of the offer.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/monkey council.png">
                        <figcaption>Flame-kissed [plenary] nullifies the blue apostate. Circular seating breeds linear guilt. Microphones bear witness to the [unuttered] sin. This is the inverse of democracy. This is monkey parliament.</figcaption>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/monkey keanu.png">
                        <figcaption>The face is a [compromise]. Eyes like apertures into a zoological uncanny. Flags wave for no one. Fire on both sides suggests a [choice], but entropy is bipartisan. The suit fits none of us.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/the eyes.png">
                        <figcaption>Quadrants of filtered [judgement]. Lorem ipsum as incantation. Four gazes. None blink. The glasses protect us from knowing, not from being [seen]. Warhol died for this.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/the outside.png">
                        <figcaption>An image of an image of a [place]. The dots imply a gap that cannot be traversed; cognitive or literal. Hydration and soda are your twin [gaolers]. The house is small because you forgot it.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="writing/images/propaganda/the spirit realm.png">
                        <figcaption>Permeable [horizon]. Spectral ambulation. The sand remembers what the ape does not. The text floats above like a broken [subtitle] in a dream you didn't have. You were never not here.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>Letters arranged as [warnings], not as language. The tracks are not rails but rituals. Text is both law and [lament].</figcaption>

                    <blockquote style="text-align:center;">
                        <p><b>who invited the monkey?</b></p>

                        <p><em>who invited the monkey?</em><br>
                        we said<br>
                        the door creaked open<br>
                        what a sight</p>

                        <p>oh, the room grows silent?<br>
                        and the chairs shift<br>
                        a hundred needles, more<br>
                        back to business, anyway<br></p>

                        <p><em>who invited the monkey?</em><br>
                        we grew louder, though,<br>
                        it was okay for us, you see<br>
                        we drink from tea cups after all</p>

                        <p>we? who is we?<br>
                        surely not the hair on the back,<br>
                        nor the fingers on the feet<br>
                        surely not me, who took my seat</p>

                        <p><em>who invited the monkey?</em><br>
                        i wore a ribbon and a pin<br>
                        i matched their shoes, i tucked my chin<br>
                        i watched them stare, i held my grin</p>

                        <p>i stirred my tea the way they do<br>
                        a little wrist, a digit askew<br>
                        still their glances shot right through<br>
                        as if i'd broken my cup in two</p>

                        <p><em>who invited the monkey?</em><br>
                        my hands, all wrong, my vowels were too<br>
                        they sat in pale pink and blue<br>
                        i wore the same, but not their hue</p>

                        <p><em>"who invited the monkey,"</em> they whispered<br>
                        but the monkey was me.</p>
