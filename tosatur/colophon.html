                    <h1>COLOPHON</h1>

                    <p>This site is written entirely by hand, in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code.</a> I want to eventually create a static site generator for it, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.</p>

                    <p>This is the 3rd redesign of the website. I wanted to go for a more terminal-esque experience this time. I also ditched the idea of having everything in lowercase, as it didn't fit the aesthetic I was going for.</p>

                    <p>The background image is from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tropical_evergreen_jungle,_Khao_Lak,_Thailand.jpg">here.</a> I mainly use <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a> to make the drawings.</p>

                    <p>This site is hosted on <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase.</a> I chose it because of how easy it is to deploy to, and how quickly it can deliver content.</p>

                    <p>The site lacks any Javascript, other than a visit counter on the <a href="index.html">home page.</a> This is because I didn't want users who block Javascript to be unable to use the site.</p>

                    <p>File sizes were a big factor in the design of this website; I try to compress all content as much as possible. I have set up a <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Action</a> to automatically minify all HTML, JS, and CSS files before deployment.</p>
